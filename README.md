# Homebox MCP Server

This repository contains the Homebox MCP Server, a Go application that acts as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for a [Homebox](https://github.com/sysadminsmedia/homebox) installation.

## Overview

The Homebox MCP Server allows AI applications, like large language models (LLMs), to connect with your Homebox data and perform actions on your behalf. It exposes the Homebox API as a set of tools that can be used by an MCP client.

For more detailed information about the server, including setup, usage, and a full list of supported features, please see the [README.md file in the `homebox-mcp-server` directory](./homebox-mcp-server/README.md).
